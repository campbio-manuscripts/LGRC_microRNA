The line in the preprocessing script:

write.table2(isoform.snp.overlap, "../../Data/MicroRNA/LGRC_MicroRNA_Overlap_SNP_All_Samples.txt")

should have been:

write.table2(isoform.snp.overlap, "../../Data/MicroRNA/LGRC_MicroRNA_Isoform_Overlap_SNP_All_Samples.txt")

This originally made the file "LGRC_MicroRNA_Overlap_SNP_All_Samples.txt" contain isomiRs (n=1291) features instead of general miRNAs (n=693). However, the matrix stored in the RDS file was correct. To fix the file, the following line of code was run on 8/29/2021:

> library(affy)
> d = readRDS("../../Data/MicroRNA/LGRC_MicroRNA_Overlap_SNP_All_Samples.rds")
> m = exprs(d)
> write.table(matrix(c("ID", colnames(m)), nrow=1), "../../Data/MicroRNA/LGRC_MicroRNA_Overlap_SNP_All_Samples.txt", sep="\t", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
> write.table(m, "../../Data/MicroRNA/LGRC_MicroRNA_Overlap_SNP_All_Samples.txt", sep="\t", row.names=TRUE, col.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE, append=TRUE)
