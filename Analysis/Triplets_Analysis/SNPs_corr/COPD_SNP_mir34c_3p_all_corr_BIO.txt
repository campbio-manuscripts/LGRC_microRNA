rs1483025_A	chr11	105005936	59	CASP5 RefSeq Summary (NM_001136110): This gene encodes a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease (caspase) family. Sequential activation of caspases plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. Caspases exist as inactive proenzymes which undergo proteolytic processing at conserved aspartic residues to produce two subunits, large and small, that dimerize to form the active enzyme. Overexpression of the active form of this enzyme induces apoptosis in fibroblasts. Max, a central component of the Myc/Max/Mad transcription regulation network important for cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, is cleaved by this protein; this process requires Fas-mediated dephosphorylation of Max. The expression of this gene is regulated by interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified for this gene.

rs4147268_T	chr1	217084292	28	ESRRG RefSeq Summary (NM_206595): This gene encodes a member of the estrogen receptor-related receptor (ESRR) family, which belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. All members of the ESRR family share an almost identical DNA binding domain, which is composed of two C4-type zinc finger motifs. The ESRR members are orphan nuclear receptors; they bind to the estrogen response element and steroidogenic factor 1 response element, and activate genes controlled by both response elements in the absence of any ligands. The ESRR family is closely related to the estrogen receptor (ER) family. They share target genes, co-regulators and promoters, and by targeting the same set of genes, the ESRRs seem to interfere with the ER-mediated estrogen response in various ways. It has been reported that the family member encoded by this gene functions as a transcriptional activator of DNA cytosine-5-methyltransferases 1 (Dnmt1) expression by direct binding to its response elements in the DNMT1 promoters, modulates cell proliferation and estrogen signaling in breast cancer, and negatively regulates bone morphogenetic protein 2-induced osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, which mainly differ at the 5' end and some of which encode protein isoforms differing in the N-terminal region. TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the heart, kidney, brain, lung, bone marrow, adrenal gland, trachea, spinal cord and thyroid gland.

rs9349637_G	chr6	52469023	5	EFHC1 RefSeq Summary (NM_001172420): This gene encodes an EF-hand-containing calcium binding protein. The encoded protein likely plays a role in calcium homeostasis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with susceptibility to juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and juvenile absence epilepsy. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described.
kgp6246477_G	chr20	32737218	2	COMMD7 Description: Homo sapiens COMM domain containing 7 (COMMD7), transcript variant 1, mRNA. TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed with highest expression in lung.
rs10762569_C	chr10	53877006	2	PCDH15 RefSeq Summary (NM_001142772): This gene is a member of the cadherin superfamily. Family members encode integral membrane proteins that mediate calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. It plays an essential role in maintenance of normal retinal and cochlear function. Mutations in this gene result in hearing loss and Usher Syndrome Type IF (USH1F). Extensive alternative splicing resulting in multiple isoforms has been observed in the mouse ortholog. Similar alternatively spliced transcripts are inferred to occur in human, and additional variants are likely to occur. TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in brain, lung, kidney, spleen and testis. Found also in the inner and outer synaptic layers, and the nerve fiber layer in adult and fetal retinas. Found in the supporting cells, outer sulcus cells and spiral ganglion of fetal cochlea. Expressed in cytotoxic tumor-derived T- and NK-cell lines as well as biopsies of nasal NK/T-cell lymphomas. Not detected in normal or in vitro activated peripheral blood cells, CD4 or CD8 lymphocytes or NK cells. Isoform 3 is expressed in brain, heart, cerebellum and kidney. CD1 isoforms, such as isoform 1, have a limited pattern of expression and is detected in testis, retina and cochlea. CD2 isoforms, such as isoforms 4 and 5, are expressed in heart, kidney, thymus, spleen, testis, retina and cochlea. CD3 isoforms, such as isoform 6, are widely expressed.

rs587985_C	chr11	119244095	1	CBL RefSeq Summary (NM_005188): This gene is a proto-oncogene that encodes a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase. The encoded protein is one of the enzymes required for targeting substrates for degradation by the proteasome. This protein mediates the transfer of ubiquitin from ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2) to specific substrates. This protein also contains an N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domain that allows it to interact with numerous tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates and target them for proteasome degradation. As such it functions as a negative regulator of many signal transduction pathways. This gene has been found to be mutated or translocated in many cancers including acute myeloid leukaemia. Mutations in this gene are also the cause of Noonan syndrome-like disorder.
