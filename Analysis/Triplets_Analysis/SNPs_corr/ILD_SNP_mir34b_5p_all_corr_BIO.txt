rs2734335_T	chr6	31893944	3	EHMT2 RefSeq Summary (NM_001289413): This gene encodes a methyltransferase that methylates lysine residues of histone H3. Methylation of H3 at lysine 9 by this protein results in recruitment of additional epigenetic regulators and repression of transcription. This gene was initially thought to be two different genes, NG36 and G9a, adjacent to each other in the HLA locus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
rs4459934_G	chr3	77123961	2	ROBO2 RefSeq Summary (NM_001128929): The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the ROBO family, part of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins that are highly conserved from fly to human. The encoded protein is a transmembrane receptor for the slit homolog 2 protein and functions in axon guidance and cell migration. Mutations in this gene are associated with vesicoureteral reflux, characterized by the backward flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters or the kidney. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The encoded protein is a transmembrane receptor for the slit homolog 2 protein and functions in axon guidance and cell migration.

rs5754521_C	chr22	33711229	1	LARGE RefSeq Summary (NM_004737): This gene, which is one of the largest in the human genome, encodes a member of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase gene family. It encodes a glycosyltransferase which participates in glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, and may carry out the synthesis of glycoprotein and glycosphingolipid sugar chains. It may also be involved in the addition of a repeated disaccharide unit. Mutations in this gene cause MDC1D, a novel form of congenital muscular dystrophy with severe mental retardation and abnormal glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants that encode the same protein.
kgp1528198_G	chr8	40701174	1	ZMAT4 Description: Homo sapiens zinc finger, matrin-type 4 (ZMAT4), transcript variant 1, mRNA.
