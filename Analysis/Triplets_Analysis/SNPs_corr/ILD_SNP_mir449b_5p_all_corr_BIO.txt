rs2734335_T	chr6	31893944	3	EHMT2 RefSeq Summary (NM_001289413): This gene encodes a methyltransferase that methylates lysine residues of histone H3. Methylation of H3 at lysine 9 by this protein results in recruitment of additional epigenetic regulators and repression of transcription. This gene was initially thought to be two different genes, NG36 and G9a, adjacent to each other in the HLA locus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
kgp9953559_G	chr3	190558644	3	IL1RAP RefSeq Summary (NM_002182): Interleukin 1 induces synthesis of acute phase and proinflammatory proteins during infection, tissue damage, or stress, by forming a complex at the cell membrane with an interleukin 1 receptor and an accessory protein. This gene encodes the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein. The protein is a necessary part of the interleukin 1 receptor complex which initiates signalling events that result in the activation of interleukin 1-responsive genes. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding two different isoforms, one membrane-bound and one soluble. The ratio of soluble to membrane-bound forms increases during acute-phase induction or stress.

rs4459934_G	chr3	77123961	2	ROBO2 RefSeq Summary (NM_001128929): The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the ROBO family, part of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins that are highly conserved from fly to human. The encoded protein is a transmembrane receptor for the slit homolog 2 protein and functions in axon guidance and cell migration. Mutations in this gene are associated with vesicoureteral reflux, characterized by the backward flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters or the kidney. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

rs8061907_G	chr16	83016516	2	CDH13 RefSeq Summary (NM_001257): This gene encodes a member of the cadherin superfamily. The encoded protein is localized to the surface of the cell membrane and is anchored by a GPI moiety, rather than by a transmembrane domain. The protein lacks the cytoplasmic domain characteristic of other cadherins, and so is not thought to be a cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein. This protein acts as a negative regulator of axon growth during neural differentiation. It also protects vascular endothelial cells from apoptosis due to oxidative stress, and is associated with resistance to atherosclerosis. The gene is hypermethylated in many types of cancer. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in heart. In the CNS, expressed in cerebral cortex, medulla, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and substantia nigra. No expression detected in cerebellum or spinal cord.
rs9830737_G	chr3	190537545	1	IL1RAP RefSeq Summary (NM_001167929): Interleukin 1 induces synthesis of acute phase and proinflammatory proteins during infection, tissue damage, or stress, by forming a complex at the cell membrane with an interleukin 1 receptor and an accessory protein. This gene encodes the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein. The protein is a necessary part of the interleukin 1 receptor complex which initiates signalling events that result in the activation of interleukin 1-responsive genes. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding two different isoforms, one membrane-bound and one soluble. The ratio of soluble to membrane-bound forms increases during acute-phase induction or stress.TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Detected in liver, skin, placenta, thymus and lung.
