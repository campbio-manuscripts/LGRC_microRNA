kgp6639144_T	chr20	59746812	45	PHACTR3 RefSeq Summary (NM_080672): This gene encodes a member of the phosphatase and actin regulator protein family. The encoded protein is associated with the nuclear scaffold in proliferating cells, and binds to actin and the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1, suggesting that it functions as a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase-1. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Abundantly expressed in brain. Also found in several tumors such as lung carcinomas, nervous tumors and HL-60 leukemia cells. Isoform 3 is the major form in U-937, GOTO and HL- 60 leukemia cells.
kgp1404116_A	chr4	17475104	11	QDPR RefSeq Summary (NM_000320): This gene encodes the enzyme dihydropteridine reductase, which catalyzes the NADH-mediated reduction of quinonoid dihydrobiopterin. This enzyme is an essential component of the pterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylating systems. Mutations in this gene resulting in QDPR deficiency include aberrant splicing, amino acid substitutions, insertions, or premature terminations. Dihydropteridine reductase deficiency presents as atypical phenylketonuria due to insufficient production of biopterin, a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase.
rs618555_T	chr1	86481084	2	CLCA1 Description: May be involved in mediating calcium-activated chloride conductance. May play critical roles in goblet cell metaplasia, mucus hypersecretion, cystic fibrosis and AHR. May be involved in the regulation of mucus production and/or secretion by goblet cells. Involved in the regulation of tissue inflammation in the innate immune response. May play a role as a tumor suppressor. Induces MUC5AC. TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in small intestine and colon namely in intestinal basal crypt epithelia and goblet cells, and appendix. Weakly expressed in uterus, testis and kidney. Expressed in the airways epithelium of both asthmatic and healthy patients. Expressed in the bronchial epithelium, especially in mucus- producing goblet cells. Expressed in normal turbinate mucosa and nasal polyp.
rs2734335_T	chr6	31893944	4	EHMT2 RefSeq Summary (NM_001289413): This gene encodes a methyltransferase that methylates lysine residues of histone H3. Methylation of H3 at lysine 9 by this protein results in recruitment of additional epigenetic regulators and repression of transcription. This gene was initially thought to be two different genes, NG36 and G9a, adjacent to each other in the HLA locus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
rs4459934_G	chr3	77123961	1	ROBO2 RefSeq Summary (NM_001128929): The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the ROBO family, part of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins that are highly conserved from fly to human. The encoded protein is a transmembrane receptor for the slit homolog 2 protein and functions in axon guidance and cell migration. Mutations in this gene are associated with vesicoureteral reflux, characterized by the backward flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters or the kidney. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

rs8061907_G	chr16	83016516	2	CDH13 RefSeq Summary (NM_001257): This gene encodes a member of the cadherin superfamily. The encoded protein is localized to the surface of the cell membrane and is anchored by a GPI moiety, rather than by a transmembrane domain. The protein lacks the cytoplasmic domain characteristic of other cadherins, and so is not thought to be a cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein. This protein acts as a negative regulator of axon growth during neural differentiation. It also protects vascular endothelial cells from apoptosis due to oxidative stress, and is associated with resistance to atherosclerosis. The gene is hypermethylated in many types of cancer. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in heart. In the CNS, expressed in cerebral cortex, medulla, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and substantia nigra. No expression detected in cerebellum or spinal cord.
rs9830737_G	chr3	190537545	1	IL1RAP RefSeq Summary (NM_001167929): Interleukin 1 induces synthesis of acute phase and proinflammatory proteins during infection, tissue damage, or stress, by forming a complex at the cell membrane with an interleukin 1 receptor and an accessory protein. This gene encodes the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein. The protein is a necessary part of the interleukin 1 receptor complex which initiates signalling events that result in the activation of interleukin 1-responsive genes. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding two different isoforms, one membrane-bound and one soluble. The ratio of soluble to membrane-bound forms increases during acute-phase induction or stress.TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Detected in liver, skin, placenta, thymus and lung.

rs5754521_C	chr22	33711229	1	LARGE RefSeq Summary (NM_004737): This gene, which is one of the largest in the human genome, encodes a member of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase gene family. It encodes a glycosyltransferase which participates in glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, and may carry out the synthesis of glycoprotein and glycosphingolipid sugar chains. It may also be involved in the addition of a repeated disaccharide unit. Mutations in this gene cause MDC1D, a novel form of congenital muscular dystrophy with severe mental retardation and abnormal glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants that encode the same protein.
