kgp6639144_T	chr20	59746812	60	PHACTR3 RefSeq Summary (NM_080672): This gene encodes a member of the phosphatase and actin regulator protein family. The encoded protein is associated with the nuclear scaffold in proliferating cells, and binds to actin and the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1, suggesting that it functions as a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase-1. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Abundantly expressed in brain. Also found in several tumors such as lung carcinomas, nervous tumors and HL-60 leukemia cells. Isoform 3 is the major form in U-937, GOTO and HL- 60 leukemia cells.

kgp7779523_T	chr10	82627614	6	NRG3 RefSeq Summary (NM_001165973): This gene is a member of the neuregulin gene family. This gene family encodes ligands for the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors ERBB3 and ERBB4 - members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. Ligand binding activates intracellular signaling cascades and the induction of cellular responses including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival or apoptosis. This gene encodes neuregulin 3 (NRG3). NRG3 has been shown to activate the tyrosine phosphorylation of its cognate receptor, ERBB4, and is thought to influence neuroblast proliferation, migration and differentiation by signalling through ERBB4. NRG3 also promotes mammary differentiation during embryogenesis. Linkage studies have implicated this gene as a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. Additional transcript variants have been described but their biological validity has not been verified.TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in most regions of the brain with the exception of corpus callosum. Expressed at lower level in testis. Not detected in heart, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate, ovary, small intestine, colon and peripheral blood leukocytes.

rs2734335_T	chr6	31893944	4	EHMT2 RefSeq Summary (NM_001289413): This gene encodes a methyltransferase that methylates lysine residues of histone H3. Methylation of H3 at lysine 9 by this protein results in recruitment of additional epigenetic regulators and repression of transcription. This gene was initially thought to be two different genes, NG36 and G9a, adjacent to each other in the HLA locus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

kgp1508742_C	chr1	22590331	3	EPHA8 RefSeq Summary (NM_020526): This gene encodes a member of the ephrin receptor subfamily of the protein-tyrosine kinase family. EPH and EPH-related receptors have been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous system. Receptors in the EPH subfamily typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The ephrin receptors are divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular domain sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands. The protein encoded by this gene functions as a receptor for ephrin A2, A3 and A5 and plays a role in short-range contact-mediated axonal guidance during development of the mammalian nervous system.

rs4459934_G	chr3	77123961	2	ROBO2 RefSeq Summary (NM_001128929): The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the ROBO family, part of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins that are highly conserved from fly to human. The encoded protein is a transmembrane receptor for the slit homolog 2 protein and functions in axon guidance and cell migration. Mutations in this gene are associated with vesicoureteral reflux, characterized by the backward flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters or the kidney. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

kgp5978297_C	chr8	105391381	1	ZFPM2 RefSeq Summary (NM_012082): The zinc finger protein encoded by this gene is a widely expressed member of the FOG family of transcription factors. The family members modulate the activity of GATA family proteins, which are important regulators of hematopoiesis and cardiogenesis in mammals. It has been demonstrated that the protein can both activate and down-regulate expression of GATA-target genes, suggesting different modulation in different promoter contexts. A related mRNA suggests an alternatively spliced product but this information is not yet fully supported by the sequence.
