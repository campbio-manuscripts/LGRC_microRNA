rs1483025_A	chr11	105005936	58	CASP5 RefSeq Summary (NM_001136112): This gene encodes a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease (caspase) family. Sequential activation of caspases plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. Caspases exist as inactive proenzymes which undergo proteolytic processing at conserved aspartic residues to produce two subunits, large and small, that dimerize to form the active enzyme. Overexpression of the active form of this enzyme induces apoptosis in fibroblasts. Max, a central component of the Myc/Max/Mad transcription regulation network important for cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, is cleaved by this protein; this process requires Fas-mediated dephosphorylation of Max. The expression of this gene is regulated by interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified for this gene.

rs4147268_T	chr1	217084292	13	ESRRG RefSeq Summary (NM_206595): This gene encodes a member of the estrogen receptor-related receptor (ESRR) family, which belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. All members of the ESRR family share an almost identical DNA binding domain, which is composed of two C4-type zinc finger motifs. The ESRR members are orphan nuclear receptors; they bind to the estrogen response element and steroidogenic factor 1 response element, and activate genes controlled by both response elements in the absence of any ligands. The ESRR family is closely related to the estrogen receptor (ER) family. They share target genes, co-regulators and promoters, and by targeting the same set of genes, the ESRRs seem to interfere with the ER-mediated estrogen response in various ways. It has been reported that the family member encoded by this gene functions as a transcriptional activator of DNA cytosine-5-methyltransferases 1 (Dnmt1) expression by direct binding to its response elements in the DNMT1 promoters, modulates cell proliferation and estrogen signaling in breast cancer, and negatively regulates bone morphogenetic protein 2-induced osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, which mainly differ at the 5' end and some of which encode protein isoforms differing in the N-terminal region. TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the heart, kidney, brain, lung, bone marrow, adrenal gland, trachea, spinal cord and thyroid gland.

rs9349637_G	chr6	52469023	7	EFHC1 Description: Homo sapiens EF-hand domain (C-terminal) containing 1 (EFHC1), transcript variant A, mRNA. RefSeq Summary (NM_018100): This gene encodes an EF-hand-containing calcium binding protein. The encoded protein likely plays a role in calcium homeostasis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with susceptibility to juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and juvenile absence epilepsy. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described. 
kgp2263580_T	chr12	122591751	5	KNTC1 RefSeq Summary (NM_014708): This gene encodes a protein that is one of many involved in mechanisms to ensure proper chromosome segregation during cell division. Experimental evidence indicated that the encoded protein functioned in a similar manner to that of the Drosophila rough deal protein.
