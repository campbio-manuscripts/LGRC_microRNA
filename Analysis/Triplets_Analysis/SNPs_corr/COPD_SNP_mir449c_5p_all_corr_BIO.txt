rs1483025_A	chr11	105005936	208	CASP5 RefSeq Summary (NM_001136110): This gene encodes a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease (caspase) family. Sequential activation of caspases plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. Caspases exist as inactive proenzymes which undergo proteolytic processing at conserved aspartic residues to produce two subunits, large and small, that dimerize to form the active enzyme. Overexpression of the active form of this enzyme induces apoptosis in fibroblasts. Max, a central component of the Myc/Max/Mad transcription regulation network important for cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, is cleaved by this protein; this process requires Fas-mediated dephosphorylation of Max. The expression of this gene is regulated by interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified for this gene.

rs1699081_G	chr11	104958571	52	CASP4 RefSeq Summary (NM_033306): This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease (caspase) family. Sequential activation of caspases plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. Caspases exist as inactive proenzymes composed of a prodomain and a large and small protease subunit. Activation of caspases requires proteolytic processing at conserved internal aspartic residues to generate a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of the large and small subunits. This caspase is able to cleave and activate its own precursor protein, as well as caspase 1 precursor. When overexpressed, this gene induces cell apoptosis. Alternative splicing results in transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.

rs4147268_T	chr1	217084292	19	ESRRG RefSeq Summary (NM_206595): This gene encodes a member of the estrogen receptor-related receptor (ESRR) family, which belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. All members of the ESRR family share an almost identical DNA binding domain, which is composed of two C4-type zinc finger motifs. The ESRR members are orphan nuclear receptors; they bind to the estrogen response element and steroidogenic factor 1 response element, and activate genes controlled by both response elements in the absence of any ligands. The ESRR family is closely related to the estrogen receptor (ER) family. They share target genes, co-regulators and promoters, and by targeting the same set of genes, the ESRRs seem to interfere with the ER-mediated estrogen response in various ways. It has been reported that the family member encoded by this gene functions as a transcriptional activator of DNA cytosine-5-methyltransferases 1 (Dnmt1) expression by direct binding to its response elements in the DNMT1 promoters, modulates cell proliferation and estrogen signaling in breast cancer, and negatively regulates bone morphogenetic protein 2-induced osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, which mainly differ at the 5' end and some of which encode protein isoforms differing in the N-terminal region. TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the heart, kidney, brain, lung, bone marrow, adrenal gland, trachea, spinal cord and thyroid gland.
kgp741070_T	chr21	33558967	16	SON RefSeq Summary (NM_032195): This gene encodes a protein that contains multiple simple repeats. The encoded protein binds RNA and promotes pre-mRNA splicing, particularly of transcripts with poor splice sites. The protein also recognizes a specific DNA sequence found in the human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and represses HBV core promoter activity. There is a pseudogene for this gene on chromosome 1. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

rs1073525_A	chr10	46024620	4	NCOA4 RefSeq Summary (NM_001145263): This gene encodes an androgen receptor coactivator. The encoded protein interacts with the androgen receptor in a ligand-dependent manner to enhance its transcriptional activity. Chromosomal translocations between this gene and the ret tyrosine kinase gene, also located on chromosome 10, have been associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described. Pseudogenes are present on chromosomes 4, 5, 10, and 14.
kgp2263580_T	chr12	122591751	4	KNTC1 RefSeq Summary (NM_014708): This gene encodes a protein that is one of many involved in mechanisms to ensure proper chromosome segregation during cell division. Experimental evidence indicated that the encoded protein functioned in a similar manner to that of the Drosophila rough deal protein.

kgp8017900_C	chr3	68466154	2	FAM19A1 RefSeq Summary (NM_001252216): This gene is a member of the TAFA family which is composed of five highly homologous genes that encode small secreted proteins. These proteins contain conserved cysteine residues at fixed positions, and are distantly related to MIP-1alpha, a member of the CC-chemokine family. The TAFA proteins are predominantly expressed in specific regions of the brain, and are postulated to function as brain-specific chemokines or neurokines that act as regulators of immune and nervous cells.

rs587985_C	chr11	119244095	1	CBL RefSeq Summary (NM_005188): This gene is a proto-oncogene that encodes a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase. The encoded protein is one of the enzymes required for targeting substrates for degradation by the proteasome. This protein mediates the transfer of ubiquitin from ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2) to specific substrates. This protein also contains an N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domain that allows it to interact with numerous tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates and target them for proteasome degradation. As such it functions as a negative regulator of many signal transduction pathways. This gene has been found to be mutated or translocated in many cancers including acute myeloid leukaemia. Mutations in this gene are also the cause of Noonan syndrome-like disorder.

rs992617_G	chr8	17996495	1	PCM1 RefSeq Summary (NM_006197): The protein encoded by this gene is a component of centriolar satellites, which are electron dense granules scattered around centrosomes. Inhibition studies show that this protein is essential for the correct localization of several centrosomal proteins, and for anchoring microtubules to the centrosome. Chromosomal aberrations involving this gene are associated with papillary thyroid carcinomas and a variety of hematological malignancies, including atypical chronic myeloid leukemia and T-cell lymphoma. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

kgp7015129_A	chr3	188415807	1	LPP RefSeq Summary (NM_005578): This gene encodes a member of a subfamily of LIM domain proteins that are characterized by an N-terminal proline-rich region and three C-terminal LIM domains. The encoded protein localizes to the cell periphery in focal adhesions and may be involved in cell-cell adhesion and cell motility. This protein also shuttles through the nucleus and may function as a transcriptional co-activator. This gene is located at the junction of certain disease-related chromosomal translocations, which result in the expression of chimeric proteins that may promote tumor growth. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
