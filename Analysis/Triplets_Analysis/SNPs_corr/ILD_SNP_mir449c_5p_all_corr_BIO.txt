kgp6639144_T	chr20	59746812	45	PHACTR3 RefSeq Summary (NM_080672): This gene encodes a member of the phosphatase and actin regulator protein family. The encoded protein is associated with the nuclear scaffold in proliferating cells, and binds to actin and the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1, suggesting that it functions as a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase-1. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Abundantly expressed in brain. Also found in several tumors such as lung carcinomas, nervous tumors and HL-60 leukemia cells. Isoform 3 is the major form in U-937, GOTO and HL- 60 leukemia cells.

kgp1404116_A	chr4	17475104	11	QDPR RefSeq Summary (NM_000320): This gene encodes the enzyme dihydropteridine reductase, which catalyzes the NADH-mediated reduction of quinonoid dihydrobiopterin. This enzyme is an essential component of the pterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylating systems. Mutations in this gene resulting in QDPR deficiency include aberrant splicing, amino acid substitutions, insertions, or premature terminations. Dihydropteridine reductase deficiency presents as atypical phenylketonuria due to insufficient production of biopterin, a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase.
kgp7779523_T	chr10	82627614	10	NRG3 RefSeq Summary (NM_001165973): This gene is a member of the neuregulin gene family. This gene family encodes ligands for the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors ERBB3 and ERBB4 - members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. Ligand binding activates intracellular signaling cascades and the induction of cellular responses including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival or apoptosis. This gene encodes neuregulin 3 (NRG3). NRG3 has been shown to activate the tyrosine phosphorylation of its cognate receptor, ERBB4, and is thought to influence neuroblast proliferation, migration and differentiation by signalling through ERBB4. NRG3 also promotes mammary differentiation during embryogenesis. Linkage studies have implicated this gene as a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. Additional transcript variants have been described but their biological validity has not been verified.TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in most regions of the brain with the exception of corpus callosum. Expressed at lower level in testis. Not detected in heart, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate, ovary, small intestine, colon and peripheral blood leukocytes.

rs2734335_T	chr6	31893944	4	EHMT2 RefSeq Summary (NM_001289413): This gene encodes a methyltransferase that methylates lysine residues of histone H3. Methylation of H3 at lysine 9 by this protein results in recruitment of additional epigenetic regulators and repression of transcription. This gene was initially thought to be two different genes, NG36 and G9a, adjacent to each other in the HLA locus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

rs618555_T	chr1	86481084	2	CLCA1 Description: May be involved in mediating calcium-activated chloride conductance. May play critical roles in goblet cell metaplasia, mucus hypersecretion, cystic fibrosis and AHR. May be involved in the regulation of mucus production and/or secretion by goblet cells. Involved in the regulation of tissue inflammation in the innate immune response. May play a role as a tumor suppressor. Induces MUC5AC. TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in small intestine and colon namely in intestinal basal crypt epithelia and goblet cells, and appendix. Weakly expressed in uterus, testis and kidney. Expressed in the airways epithelium of both asthmatic and healthy patients. Expressed in the bronchial epithelium, especially in mucus- producing goblet cells. Expressed in normal turbinate mucosa and nasal polyp.

rs4459934_G	chr3	77123961	2	ROBO2 RefSeq Summary (NM_001128929): The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the ROBO family, part of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins that are highly conserved from fly to human. The encoded protein is a transmembrane receptor for the slit homolog 2 protein and functions in axon guidance and cell migration. Mutations in this gene are associated with vesicoureteral reflux, characterized by the backward flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters or the kidney. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
